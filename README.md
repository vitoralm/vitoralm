Hi there! 👋

I'm Vitor Almeida Pires, Senior QA Engineer from Goiânia, Brazil 🇧🇷 with over 10 years (including 5 years working full remotely) of experience in agile quality processes and software development using a big variety of programming languages and test frameworks.  I believe that seeking innovation and sharing knowledge with the team is the best way to deliver high-quality software.


👨🏽‍💻 What I do
- 💻 QA & Test Automation: Strongly experienced in scrum and kanban environments and all the challenges that could come from working in small-team startups with a fast paced growth until multinational companies with a established software development culture, mature and processes and widely distributed teams. Able to work on building a whole test plan with the more valuable and modern strategies, effective issue tracking and constant product quality feedback
- 🛠️ Programming languages, frameworks and tools: Playwright, Cypress, Appium, Postman, Pact, Proxyman, Python (Pytest, Behave, Tavern, Flask, Django), JavaScript (Jest, Mocha, Node.js), TypeScript, Docker, CI/CD (Github Actions and Jenkins)
- 🚀 Great communicator with passion about collaborating, reinforcing the QA culture and improving processes to positively impact the software quality
- 📌 Always learning
- I'm always looking for ways to refine and optimize software development and testing processes. I enjoy exchanging ideas and discussing best practices with other professionals in the field
